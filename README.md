## Code Solution
The Feature Request App allows users create feature requests with respect to clients, by identifying product area the
 request should categorized under. 

The following were measures taken around application workflow;

* As a form of security, only registered users can create feature requests..
* User is expected to register and login with a secured password combination.
* Logged-In user can create feature request associated with a client and product area.
* Only a Feature request author has the right to make modifications to created feature requests.
* Only a Feature request author has the right to delete an existing feature request.
